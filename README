The idea is to request real time user location and detect user movement, each time the 
user moves at least 10m, a message will be displayed "You have moved <number of metres>
metres from your previous position.

The architect of the project is very simple.

LocationManager.swift contains the methods to request user location using 
CoreLocation Framework and the ViewController will collect locations and decide whether
the user has moved for more than 10 metres, then display the result to user.

The location data is passed to viewcontroller using closure and delegate, I belive it is
a neat way and the code would be very easy to read.

The whole project took about 3 hours of coding. In addition, I also spent some extra time
trying to make the UI looks a bit better, after a few attempts I decided to stay the simply
UI and it may need improvement in the future.
